== FreshHead

Welcome to my project app, FreshHead! With it, a joyful user is served one fact, one poem, one quote, and one news abstract per day (UTC). Each day that a user absorbs this full compliment of mentally freshening data, that user will get a positive affirmation, and the day will count toward that users freshness streakâ€¦ Very satisfying and very rewarding!
